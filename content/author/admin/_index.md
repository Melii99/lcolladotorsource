At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, I am part of the Data Science team whose goals include better understanding and characterizing genomics signatures in the human brain. We use high-throughput technologies such as DNA methylation and RNA sequencing. I help mentor other team members, provide support for LIBD projects and I am advancing my academic career as part of [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/)'s lab.

As a quick background, I graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](http://unam.mx/)) in 2009 and worked for two years at Winter Genomics analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. I then got a PhD in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) thanks to a [CONACyT scholarship](http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/) awarded in 2011. I worked with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and Andrew Jaffe in developing [derfinder](http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder), [regionReport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/regionReport), [recount](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount) as well as other applied projects.

Every day I use [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/). Occasionally I blog about them and other tools. I'm a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://LieberInstitute.github.io/rstatsclub/) and the [CDSBMexico](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) community of R and Bioconductor developers in Latin America.
