<p>It’s Friday 7pm and it’s been a long week with ups and downs<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. But I’m enthused as I write this blog post. In less than a month from now I’ll be attending <a href="http://unconf18.ropensci.org/">rOpenSci unconf18</a> and it’ll be my first time at this type of event. Yay!</p>
{{% tweet "983876013015826432" %}}
<p>In my self introduction to everyone attending, I mentioned that I don’t use the pipe (<code>%&gt;%</code>) symbol and that I use <code>&lt;-</code> for assignment.</p>

In my notes to Stefanie before our chat I had mentioned again my lack of R piping experience and we talked about it. As we talked, it became clear that a blog post on related topics would be useful. Sure, I could have asked directly to the other unconf18 participants, but maybe others from the R community in general can chime in or benefit from reading the answers.</p>
<div id="coding-style-and-git" class="section level3">
<h3>Coding style and git</h3>
<p>I’m attending unconf18 with an open mind and I think of myself as someone who can be quite flexible (not with my body!) and accommodating. I’m assuming that most participants at unconf18 will use <code>=</code> for assignment. I’m not looking to start any discussions about the different assignment operators. Simply, I am willing to use whatever the majority uses. Just like I did in my first pull request to the <code>blogdown</code> package (<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/263">issue 263</a>). I was trying to follow Yihui Xie’s coding style to make his life easier and have a clean (or cleaner) git history. From <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/bite-sized-pull-requests/">Yihui’s post on this pull request</a> I can see that he liked it.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, I think that following the coding style of others will be something I’ll do at unconf18. I haven’t really worked in any R packages with many developers actively working on the package. But I imagine that setting a common coding style will minimize git conflicts, and <strong>no one</strong> wants those<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. I don’t know if we’ll all follow some common guidelines at unconf18. I actually imagine that it’ll be project-specific. Why? Well because you can create an R project in RStudio<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and set some defaults for the project such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of spaces for tab</li>
<li>line ending conversions</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>We can also set some global RStudio preferences like whether to <em>auto-indent code after paste</em>, length of lines.</p>
<p><img src="http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2018-04-27-getting-ready-to-attend-ropensci-unconf18-and-probably-working-on-tidyverse-like-functions-for-the-first-time_files/Screen%20Shot%202018-04-27%20at%207.28.49%20PM.png" width="400" /> Additionally, we can decide whether we’ll use the RStudio “wand” to <em>reformat code</em>.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Maybe all of this is unnecessary, maybe everyone will work in different non-overlapping functions and thus avoid git conflicts. For example, at my job sometimes I write code with <code>=</code> users, but we don’t work on the same lines of the code file. Later on it becomes easy to identify who wrote which line without having to use <code>git blame</code> (awful name, right?).</p>
</div>
<div id="tidyverse-like-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidyverse-like functions</h3>
<p>So far, I think that these coding style issues are minor and will be easily dealt with. I think that we’ll all be able to adapt and instead focus on other problems (like whatever the package is trying to solve) and enjoy the experience (network, build <strong>trust</strong> as Stefanie put it).</p>
<p>My second concern has to do with something I imagine could require more effort: my homework before the unconf. That is, writing tidyverse-like functions. Like I’ve said, I haven’t used the R pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> symbol. I’ve executed some code with it before, seeing it in many blog posts, but I’ve never actually written functions designed to be compatible with this type of logic.</p>
<p>If I help write a function that is not pipe-friendly, then it might not integrate nicely with other functions written by the rest of the team. It would lead to workarounds in the vignette or maybe having someone else re-factor my first function to make it pipe-friendly. Sure, I would learn from observing others make changes to my code. But I want to take advantage as much as I can from my experience at rOpenSci unconf<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>!</p>
<p>Since I don’t really use <code>%&gt;%</code>, I’m unfamiliar with many things related to pipe-friendly (tidyverse-like) functions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you document them differently? Like make a single Rd file for multiple functions. Or do you make an Rd file per function even if the example usage doesn’t involve <code>%&gt;%</code>?</li>
<li>I know that the first argument is important in pipe-friendly functions. But I ignore if the second and other arguments play a role or not.</li>
<li>Do people use the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) argument in pipe-friendly functions? With my <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder">derfinder</a></em> package I ended up a very deep rabbit hole using <code>...</code>. I explained some of the logic in my <code>dots</code> <a href="http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/12/11/dots/#.WuO4-VMvy50">blog post</a> (there are fair criticisms to going deep with <code>...</code> in the comments).</li>
<li>How do you write unit tests for pipe-friendly functions? Similar to how you write documentation for them, do the unit tests just test one function a time or do they test several at a time (that is the output after using <code>%&gt;%</code>)?</li>
</ul>
<p>These and other questions could involve time getting familiar with. Time that I could spend now, before unconf18, learning and at least getting a better sense of what to expect. Maybe I’m complicating myself and worrying too much about this. I imagine that the solution will involve a combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking some popular tidyverse packages that use <code>%&gt;%</code>. Like the vignettes/README files and examples.</li>
<li>Reading more about this in a book(s): I don’t know which one though.</li>
<li>Playing around a bit as a user with some of these functions. See what error messages pop up: actually I don’t know how users debug a series of functions tied together via <code>%&gt;%</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="wrapping-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>I’m not saying everyone should learn about these topics before unconf18. I think that we are all (well, maybe excluding some) worried about not knowing <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <code>R</code>/<code>git</code>/<code>travis</code>/<code>testthat</code>/<code>usethis</code>/etc topic before unconf18. And that will part of why it’ll be great to meet everyone in what is known to be an extremely welcoming R conference ^^ (seriously, check <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017/">all the unconf17 posts</a>!).</p>
