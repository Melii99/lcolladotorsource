Are you a Microsoft Windows `R` user? Does your Windows username include a space? Like `Firstname Lastname`. Then you might occassionally run into issues installing packages due to spaces.

### Solutions

You could either re-install Windows with a username that has no spaces such as `Lastname`, but that's probably not an easy option. Or you can:

* Edit your `TMP` and `TEMP` environment variables to a location with no spaces, like `C:\TEMP` following instructions like [these ones](https://www.howtogeek.com/285710/how-to-move-windows-temporary-folders-to-another-drive/).
* Preferably install `R` at a location with no spaces, like `C:\R`, instead of the default `C:\Program Files`.


### Backstory

A co-worker wanted to install the `r Biocpkg('clusterprofiler')` Bioconductor package which depends on the `r Biocpkg('DO.db')` Bioconductor package. This co-worker uses a Windows machine that has a username with a space. Let's say it was me with `Leo Collado` to keep them anonymous. The `r Biocpkg('DO.db')` is only available as a "Source" package with no Windows binary as you can see [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/DO.db.html).

![](http://lcolladotor.github.io/post/2019-09-18-windows-user-space-issues-with-installing-r-packages_files/Screen Shot 2019-09-17 at 10.33.47 PM.png){width=600px}

This means that `R` has to:

1. download a `tar.gz` file,
2. uncompress it,
3. and then install it.

In particular, we are talking about [`DO.db_2.9.tar.gz`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/src/contrib/DO.db_2.9.tar.gz) in this case.

The installation instructions for `r Biocpkg('DO.db')` are:

```{r 'install DO.db', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("DO.db")
```

#### Uncompressing

Internally, `BiocManager::install()` ends up using `utils::install.packages()`. The first step, downloading, works well. Uncompressing a file in this scenario fails. Why?


```{r, eval = FALSE}
> BiocManager::install('DO.db', lib = 'C:/R/R-3.6.0/library')
Bioconductor version 3.9 (BiocManager 1.30.4), R 3.6.0 (2019-04-26)
Installing package(s) 'BiocVersion', 'DO.db'

## removed output

  incomplete block on file

The downloaded source packages are in
        ‘C:\Users\Leo Collado\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpqiBJ53\downloaded_packages’
        
```

If you search on Google the error message you'll find links like [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25487593/r-what-does-incomplete-block-on-file-mean) which hint towards an incomplete download. But the download works. You can even download the file and try to run `untar()` manually and it will fail.

We were told to try installing R at a location with no spaces, so by this point, R was installed at `C:\R\R-3.6.0\`, hence the `lib` specification you see above, though it's irrelevant for these errors.


Uncompressing the `tar.gz` file is done by `utils::untar()`. If you look at the code for `utils::untar()` you'll see:

```{r 'untar', eval = FALSE}
## The function definition of utils::untar
function (tarfile, files = NULL, list = FALSE, exdir = ".", compressed = NA, 
  extras = NULL, verbose = FALSE, restore_times = TRUE,
  support_old_tars = Sys.getenv("R_SUPPORT_OLD_TARS", 
    FALSE), tar = Sys.getenv("TAR")) 

## Inside utils::untar()
if (inherits(tarfile, "connection") || identical(tar, "internal")) {
  if (!missing(compressed)) 
    warning("argument 'compressed' is ignored for the internal method")
  return(untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir, restore_times))
}

## Further below
TAR <- tar
if (!nzchar(TAR) && .Platform$OS.type == "windows" && nzchar(Sys.which("tar.exe"))) 
  TAR <- "tar.exe"
if (!nzchar(TAR) || TAR == "internal") 
  return(untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir))
```


In this case, the first `untar2()` call is called. That is: `return(untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir, restore_times))`. The error message `incomplete block on file` is not really informative in this case because `untar2()` is not happy when there's a space in the path to the file ^[Hopefully in the future Google will lead you to this blog post and you might avoid the rabbit hole I went through!].

We can get around this `untar2()` issue by uncompressing the `tar.gz` file ourselves in a path that has no spaces. For example, if we download `DO.db_2.9.tar.gz` to `C:\R` we can uncompress the `tar.gz` file with:

```{r 'untar works', eval = FALSE}
utils::untar('C:/R/DO.db_2.9.tar.gz')
```

#### Installation

Let's proceed to installing the package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> install.packages('C:/R/DO.db', repos = NULL, type = 'source', lib = 'C:/R/R-3.6.0/library')
* installing *source* package 'DO.db' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
ARGUMENT 'Collado\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp8EQDjB\Rin2ef05088650f' __ignored__

Execution halted

ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'DO.db'
* removing 'C:/R/R-3.6.0/library/DO.db'

Warning message:
In install.packages("C:/R/DO.db", repos = NULL, type = "source",  :
  installation of package ‘C:/R/DO.db’ had non-zero exit status
>
```

Oh noes! It didn't work 😖 What happened?

If you look closely, you'll see that it says `ARGUMENT 'Collado\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp8EQDjB\Rin2ef05088650f' __ignored__`. Wait! `Collado` is the `Lastname` portion of the username! So we have another space issue ^[By the way, at this point I thought that the error was related to `Error: object 'ÿþ' not found` and maybe some encoding issues since the `r Biocpkg('DO.db')` package has Chinese characters.]. That structure though looks very familiar, it's from `base::tempdir()`!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> tempdir()

[1] "C:\\Users\\Leo Collado\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpqiBJ53"
```


The help file for `?tempdir` contained the clues to solving this issue.

We can set the `TMPDIR` environment variable which will be used by the R session spawned inside the installation of `r Biocpkg('DO.db')` and... it works! 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
> Sys.setenv(TMPDIR = 'C:/R/tmp_leo')
> Sys.getenv('TMPDIR')
[1] "C:/R/tmp_leo"
>
>
> install.packages('C:/R/DO.db', repos = NULL, type = 'source', lib = 'C:/R/R-3.6.0/library')

#### `clusterProfiler` installation

Now we can continue and install `r Biocpkg('clusterProfiler')`, right?

```{r, eval = FALSE}

```


The issue is again that `utils:::untar2()` and thus `utils::untar()` does not like spaces in the paths. If we look at where the packages were downloaded more closely, we can see a space there at `C:\Users\Leo Collado\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpqiBJ53\downloaded_packages`. If you check the help file for `utils::install.packages()` you'll see that `destdir` controls this:

> destdir	
> 
> directory where downloaded packages are stored. If it is NULL
> (the default) a subdirectory downloaded_packages of the session
> temporary directory will be used (and the files will be deleted
> at the end of the session).

If we dig into `utils::install.packages()` we can see how this comes to play.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Part of utils::install.packages()
if (is.null(destdir) && nonlocalrepos) {
  tmpd <- file.path(tempdir(), "downloaded_packages")
  if (!file.exists(tmpd) && !dir.create(tmpd)) 
    stop(gettextf("unable to create temporary directory %s", 
      sQuote(tmpd)), domain = NA)
}
```

Setting the environment variable `TMPDIR` doesn't work here as the instructions for `tempdir()` specify ^[Didn't stop me from trying hehe. I tried using `usethis::edit_r_profile()` and adding `Sys.setenv(TMPDIR = 'C:/R/tmp_leo')` but that didn't work.] although I now see that you can edit the `.Renviron` file as instructed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17107206/change-temporary-directory).


In any case, if we specify a `destdir` without spaces we overide the need to control `tempdir()`, enable `utils::untar()` to work and we can finally install `r Biocpkg('clusterProfiler')` 🎉.

### Closing

All of the above seemed like too much. In addition, it seemed like `BiocManager::install('hypeR', destdir = 'C:/R/dest_leo')` was not working ^[I would need to test this more before reporting it properly to Bioconductor.]. I likely missed something here earlier today. So controlling `utils::tempdir()` seemed like the easiest solution such that the defaults of where a package gets downloaded, uncompressed, etc all worked. And the simplest solution we thought of was to create the `C:\TEMP` directory and update the Windows environment variables `TMP` and `TEMP` to [point](https://www.howtogeek.com/285710/how-to-move-windows-temporary-folders-to-another-drive/) to that location. Then, the rest of the commands worked without having to specify `lib` or `destdir` or manually run `utils::untar()`.

As a whole, remember to look for spaces in the error messages! This is specially relevant when you are having issues as a Microsoft Windows `R` user.

If you have other solutions for Microsoft Windows `R` users with usernames that have at least one space, please let us know in the comments! Thank you! 🙌🏽
