<p>I have recently been getting reminder emails from the <em>Science</em> &amp; SciLifeLab Prize for Young Scientists. The application deadline is July 15th, 2018!</p>
<p>Last year I submitted an entry to this competition and I enjoyed the experience, even if it was a bit rushed. The process of joining the competition is relatively straight forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an essay about your Ph.D. thesis work.</li>
<li>Get a recommendation letter from your Ph.D. advisor.</li>
<li>Write a short Ph.D. thesis abstract section, list your affiliation, education, academic and professional awards and professional experience.</li>
<li>Include references.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to pay for competing! You already did the very hard part of completing your Ph.D.!!! I also like competitions like this one that invite you to think about your thesis and how to explain it. You should note that you are only eligible to participate once in this competition.</p>
<p>You can read about the 4 winners from 2017 at <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/prizes/SciLifeLab/2017">www.sciencemag.org/prizes/SciLifeLab/2017</a> and other years too to draw some inspiration from. I didn’t win, but I’m still going to share my entry in case it’s useful to others. I’m also sharing it to keep with the theme of also sharing your failures that I talked in my <a href="http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/06/11/mindfulness/#.WyrJbBJKjUI">mindfulness post</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly why my entry was not selected (you might have some ideas on how to improve it!). But I can tell you that:</p>
<ul>
<li>I knew the deadline was coming but I wrote it the week it was due.</li>
<li>I didn’t have time to ask for some more specific feedback from others.</li>
<li>I forgot that a recommendation letter was needed, so I asked at the very last minute for one by <a href="http://jtleek.com/">Jeff Leek</a>. I don’t know what magic he did (likely skipping a few hours of sleep, sorry!!!) but he managed to send it in time. Oops!</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure if I should have emphasized more the impact of my Ph.D. thesis work or what else to do. However, I do know that this exercise was useful. First, just re-reading my essay makes me smile. Also, Figure 1 shown here became a figure in the <code>recount-workflow</code> paper <a id='cite-Collado-Torres_2017'></a>(<a href='https://f1000research.com/articles/6-1558/v1'>Collado-Torres, Nellore, and Jaffe, 2017</a>). Furthermore, when I was notified about the <a href="https://bioinformatics-peer-prize-iii.thinkable.org/">Thinkable Bioinformatics Peer Prize III</a> I didn’t have to think twice about joining that competition. Finally, since I wrote it in an Rmd file, it was easy to modify for this blog post.</p>
<p>Like I’ve said, you have nothing to lose by joining this competition. Yes, you have to invest a bit of time. But it can be helpful and morale boosting! Plus, you have a chance to win it!!! Just remember that the deadline is July 15th, 2018 (and to give your advisor enough time to write their recommendation letter for you)!</p>
<p>In case you are curious, here are my full <a href="https://gist.github.com/lcolladotor/657aaae9d16aff3ce468f44f8780a317">entry files</a> (the figure is here though).</p>

<div id="usable-human-gene-expression-data-and-annotation-agnostic-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Usable human gene expression data and annotation-agnostic methods</h2>
<p>In the last decade RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the predominant assay for measuring gene expression. RNA-seq allows us to measure all expressed genes, improve gene and transcript annotation, and measure expressed sequences that otherwise are excluded in microarray studies. Typical RNA-seq analysis starts with a matrix containing the number of RNA-seq reads overlapping each gene for each sample <span class="citation">(Love et al. 2016; Law et al. 2016)</span>. To compute such a matrix, you first map the raw data to the genome with aligners such as <em>TopHat2</em> and <em>HISAT</em> <span class="citation">(Kim et al. 2013; Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015)</span> and then use tools such as <em>Rsubread</em> and <em>HTSeq</em> <span class="citation">(Y, GK, and W 2013; Anders, Pyl, and Huber 2014)</span> to construct the read count matrix. After measuring enough samples, you can determine which genes are differentially expressed between two or more groups.</p>
<p>When I started my graduate studies with Jeff Leek, the most commonly used methods for differential expression analysis were <em>DESeq</em> <span class="citation">(Anders and Huber 2010)</span> and <em>edgeR</em> <span class="citation">(Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010)</span>. Leek and colleagues put together a set of gene count matrices in a project called <em>ReCount</em> <span class="citation">(Frazee, Langmead, and Leek 2011)</span>. <em>ReCount</em> allowed researchers to access several datasets without having to run the whole processing pipeline. <em>ReCount</em> then helped the development of new methods such as <em>DESeq2</em> <span class="citation">(Love, Huber, and Anders 2014)</span>. It was also Leek and colleagues that decided to look at RNA-seq data in a manner less dependent on potentially incomplete gene annotation. With the increase in size of RNA-seq projects, they thought it would be feasible to assess the differential expression signal at base pair resolution in an approach called differentially expressed regions (DER) finder <span class="citation">(Frazee et al. 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>It was around then that I started to work with Andrew Jaffe, who had RNA-seq data from the human brain. Jaffe and colleagues hypothesized that the gene annotation for the human brain might be incomplete and were interested in applying the DER finder approach to their data. With them, I modified the DER finder approach to make it computationally feasible to analyze these human brain samples at base resolution <span class="citation">(Jaffe et al. 2015)</span>. We indeed found that the human brain transcriptome was not fully annotated and identified intronic DERs that were present in other brain datasets, including from mouse, and showed these regions were enriched for genetic risk for brain disorders. Further computational improvements to the DER finder approach yielded the <em>derfinder</em> <span class="citation">(Collado-Torres, Nellore, Frazee, et al. 2017)</span> Bioconductor <span class="citation">(Huber et al. 2015)</span> package, reducing computing time from days to hours.</p>
<p>While I was working on <em>derfinder</em>, Abhinav Nellore was developing <em>Rail-RNA</em> <span class="citation">(Nellore, Collado-Torres, et al. 2016)</span> with the goal of aligning large RNA-seq datasets. We determined that we only needed coverage data instead of alignments to use <em>derfinder</em> and to perform gene level analyses. Coverage data files are much smaller than alignment files, which meant that we could greatly reduce our storage costs when using <em>Rail-RNA</em> and allowed us to think as big as possible. Initially we looked at 21,504 human RNA-seq samples and explored the landscape of exon-exon junctions <span class="citation">(Nellore, Jaffe, et al. 2016)</span>. The reads spanning exon-exon junctions provided by <em>Rail-RNA</em> can be used for a second type of annotation-agnostic analysis as these reads provide information about exon skipping, alternative donor/acceptor sites and novel events. With a fairly conservative filter we determined that 18.6% of exon-exon junctions were missing in the annotation <span class="citation">(Nellore, Jaffe, et al. 2016)</span>. This observation along with the fact that exon-exon junctions can be used to determine differential transcript usage gave strength to this second annotation-agnostic RNA-seq analysis method.</p>
<p>Researchers around the world have shared their raw data via the Sequence Read Archive or via large consortiums such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression study (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, it still is complicated to align and compute count matrices for these datasets. We thought that if the public data was uniformly processed that we could make this large body of human expression data more reusable. We were well positioned to carry out this project and just needed resources. Luckily, Jeff Leek, Ben Langmead and others got together and funded the implementation of <em>Rail-RNA</em> to analyze all the human public RNA-seq data available at the time, over 70,000 samples.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>We computed gene count matrices for these 70,000 samples and made them available as the <em>recount2</em> resource that can be accessed at <a href="https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/">jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/</a> as well as through the <em>recount</em> <span class="citation">(Collado-Torres, Nellore, Kammers, et al. 2017)</span> Bioconductor package, thus representing a major improvement over <em>ReCount</em>. To take advantage of the data as much as possible, we also released exon and exon-exon junction count matrices as well as the coverage data files required for the DER finder approach, thus enabling both annotation-agnostic methods we developed that complement traditional methods. Figure 1 illustrates the type of information that is available via <em>recount2</em>.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I believe that <em>recount2</em> will fuel the development of new analytical methods and greatly increase the usability of the public human gene expression data researchers have collected over the years. In the meantime, we are working hard on improving the data in <em>recount2</em> <span class="citation">(Ellis, Collado-Torres, and Leek 2017; Wilks et al. 2017)</span> and exploring how to leverage results from different RNA-seq analytical approaches <span class="citation">(Jaffe et al. 2017)</span>.</p>

<div id="ph.d.thesis-abstract" class="section level2">
<h2>Ph.D. thesis abstract</h2>
<p>Leonardo Collado-Torres’ thesis work is centered around the development of R software packages for analyzing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) high throughput genomic data. The first chapter describes the <em>derfinder</em> Bioconductor package which implements the DER Finder approach for identifying differentially expressed regions with RNA-seq data in an annotation-agnostic manner. The second chapter shows how <em>derfinder</em> can be applied to ChIP-seq data to identify differentially bounded regions. The third chapter describes the <em>regionReport</em> Bioconductor package for producing HTML or PDF reports from region-based genomic analyses, such as the <em>derfinder</em> analyses described in the previous chapters. The last thesis project Leonardo Collado-Torres carried out was the development of the <em>recount2</em> resource and accompanying <em>recount</em> Bioconductor package using the <em>Rail-RNA</em> results from processing all the public human RNA-seq data at the time, which spans over 70,000 samples.</p>
