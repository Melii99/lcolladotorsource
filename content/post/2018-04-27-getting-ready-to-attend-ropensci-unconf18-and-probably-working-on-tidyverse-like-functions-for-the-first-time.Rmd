It's Friday 7pm and it's been a long week with ups and downs^[Feeling welcomed can be hard... oh well.]. But I'm enthused as I write this blog post. In less than a month from now I'll be attending [rOpenSci unconf18](http://unconf18.ropensci.org/) and it'll be my first time at this type of event. Yay!

`r blogdown::shortcode("tweet", "983876013015826432")`

In my self introduction to everyone attending, I mentioned that I don't use the pipe (`%>%`) symbol and that I use `<-` for assignment.

Recently I had my pre-unconf chat with [Stefanie Butland](https://ropensci.org/about/#team) (read more about these chats [in her great blog post](https://blog.trelliscience.com/the-value-of-welcome-part-2-how-to-prepare-40-new-community-members-for-an-unconference/)). In my notes to Stefanie before our chat I had mentioned again my lack of R piping experience and we talked about it. As we talked, it became clear that a blog post on related topics would be useful. Sure, I could have asked directly to the other unconf18 participants, but maybe others from the R community in general can chime in or benefit from reading the answers.

### Coding style and git

I'm attending unconf18 with an open mind and I think of myself as someone who can be quite flexible (not with my body!) and accommodating. I'm assuming that most participants at unconf18 will use `=` for assignment. I'm not looking to start any discussions about the different assignment operators. Simply, I am willing to use whatever the majority uses. Just like I did in my first pull request to the `blogdown` package ([issue 263](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/pull/263)). I was trying to follow Yihui Xie's coding style to make his life easier and have a clean (or cleaner) git history. From [Yihui's post on this pull request](https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/bite-sized-pull-requests/) I can see that he liked it.

Keeping this in mind, I think that following the coding style of others will be something I'll do at unconf18. I haven't really worked in any R packages with many developers actively working on the package. But I imagine that setting a common coding style will minimize git conflicts, and __no one__ wants those^[We could talk about git for a long time too. But I hope that I'll get by with some git push, git pull, and maybe git branch.]. I don't know if we'll all follow some common guidelines at unconf18. I actually imagine that it'll be project-specific. Why? Well because you can create an R project in RStudio^[It's one of the sponsors http://unconf18.ropensci.org/#sponsors and well, probably want most will be using since it has such nice tools for writing R packages.] and set some defaults for the project such as:

* the number of spaces for tab
* line ending conversions

We can also set some global RStudio preferences like whether to _auto-indent code after paste_, length of lines.

Additionally, we can decide whether we'll use the RStudio "wand" to _reformat code_.

Maybe all of this is unnecessary, maybe everyone will work in different non-overlapping functions and thus avoid git conflicts. For example, at my job sometimes I write code with `=` users, but we don't work on the same lines of the code file. Later on it becomes easy to identify who wrote which line without having to use `git blame` (awful name, right?).


### Tidyverse-like functions

So far, I think that these coding style issues are minor and will be easily dealt with. I think that we'll all be able to adapt and instead focus on other problems (like whatever the package is trying to solve) and enjoy the experience (network, build __trust__ as Stefanie put it).

My second concern has to do with something I imagine could require more effort: my homework before the unconf. That is, writing tidyverse-like functions. Like I've said, I haven't used the R pipe `%>%` symbol. I've executed some code with it before, seeing it in many blog posts, but I've never actually written functions designed to be compatible with this type of logic. 

If I help write a function that is not pipe-friendly, then it might not integrate nicely with other functions written by the rest of the team. It would lead to workarounds in the vignette or maybe having someone else re-factor my first function to make it pipe-friendly. Sure, I would learn from observing others make changes to my code. But I want to take advantage as much as I can from my experience at rOpenSci unconf^[Specially since most only attend one unconf, I think. So it's different from other conferences that you can experience multiple years and network with the group across a longer period of time: that's what I've done with the Bioconductor meetings.]! 

Since I don't really use `%>%`, I'm unfamiliar with many things related to pipe-friendly (tidyverse-like) functions. For example:

* Do you document them differently? Like make a single Rd file for multiple functions. Or do you make an Rd file per function even if the example usage doesn't involve `%>%`?
* I know that the first argument is important in pipe-friendly functions. But I ignore if the second and other arguments play a role or not.
* Do people use the ellipsis (`...`) argument in pipe-friendly functions? With my `r Biocpkg('derfinder')` package I ended up a very deep rabbit hole using `...`. I explained some of the logic in my `dots` [blog post](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/12/11/dots/#.WuO4-VMvy50) (there are fair criticisms to going deep with `...` in the comments).
* How do you write unit tests for pipe-friendly functions? Similar to how you write documentation for them, do the unit tests just test one function a time or do they test several at a time (that is the output after using `%>%`)?

These and other questions could involve time getting familiar with. Time that I could spend now, before unconf18, learning and at least getting a better sense of what to expect. Maybe I'm complicating myself and worrying too much about this. I imagine that the solution will involve a combination of:

* Checking some popular tidyverse packages that use `%>%`. Like the vignettes/README files and examples.
* Reading more about this in a book(s): I don't know which one though.
* Playing around a bit as a user with some of these functions. See what error messages pop up: actually I don't know how users debug a series of functions tied together via `%>%`.

### Wrapping up

I'm not saying everyone should learn about these topics before unconf18. I think that we are all (well, maybe excluding some) worried about not knowing $X$ or $Y$ `R`/`git`/`travis`/`testthat`/`usethis`/etc topic before unconf18. And that will part of why it'll be great to meet everyone in what is known to be an extremely welcoming R conference ^^ (seriously, check [all the unconf17 posts](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/06/02/unconf2017/)!).
