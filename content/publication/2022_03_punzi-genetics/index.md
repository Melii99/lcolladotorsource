abstract: 'Objective:  The authors sought to study the transcriptomic and genomic
  features of completed suicide by parsing the method chosen, to capture molecular
  correlates of the distinctive frame of mind of individuals who die by suicide, while
  reducing heterogeneity.  Methods:  The authors analyzed gene expression (RNA sequencing)
  from postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients who died by suicide with
  violent compared with nonviolent means, nonsuicide patients with the same psychiatric
  disorders, and a neurotypical group (total N=329). They then examined genomic risk
  scores (GRSs) for each psychiatric disorder included, and GRSs for cognition (IQ)
  and for suicide attempt, testing how they predict diagnosis or traits (total N=888).  Results:  Patients
  who died by suicide by violent means showed a transcriptomic pattern remarkably
  divergent from each of the other patient groups but less from the neurotypical group;
  consistently, their genomic profile of risk was relatively low for their diagnosed
  illness as well as for suicide attempt, and relatively high for IQ: they were more
  similar to the neurotypical group than to other patients. Differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) associated with patients who died by suicide by violent means pointed
  to purinergic signaling in microglia, showing similarities to a genome-wide association
  study of Drosophila aggression. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed
  that these DEGs were coexpressed in a context of mitochondrial metabolic activation
  unique to suicide by violent means.  Conclusions:  These findings suggest that patients
  who die by suicide by violent means are in part biologically separable from other
  patients with the same diagnoses, and their behavioral outcome may be less dependent
  on genetic risk for conventional psychiatric disorders and be associated with an
  alteration of purinergic signaling and mitochondrial metabolism.'
