abstract: Following the recent review by Merikangas et al. summarizing differential gene expression in schizophrenia, we wanted to provide readers with our perspective on the state of the field in order to highlight current resources and ongoing challenges. We have led data collection and analysis of post mortem brains of control and schizophrenia samples across multiple large-scale cohorts, and we have provided data and results resources for each of these studies (Table 1).
