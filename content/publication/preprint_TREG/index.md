abstract: Next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated data-driven identification
  of gene sets with different features including genes with stable expression, cell-type
  specific expression, or spatially variable expression. Here, we aimed to define
  and identify a new class of \"control\" genes called Total RNA Expression Genes
  (TREGs), which correlate with total RNA abundance in heterogeneous cell types of
  different sizes and transcriptional activity. We provide a data-driven method to
  identify TREGs from single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, available as an R/Bioconductor
  package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/TREG. We demonstrated the utility of
  our method in the postmortem human brain using multiplex single molecule fluorescent
  in situ hybridization (smFISH) and compared candidate TREGs against classic housekeeping
  genes. We identified _AKT3_ as a top TREG across five brain regions, especially in
  the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
