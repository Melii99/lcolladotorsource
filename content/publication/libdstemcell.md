abstract = "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a powerful model of neural differentiation and maturation. We present a hiPSC transcriptomics resource on corticogenesis from 5 iPSC donor and 13 subclonal lines across nine time points over 5 broad conditions: self-renewal, early neuronal differentiation, neural precursor cells (NPCs), assembled rosettes, and differentiated neuronal cells that were validated using electrophysiology. We identified widespread changes in the expression of individual transcript features and their splice variants, gene networks, and global patterns of transcription. We next demonstrated that co-culturing human NPCs with rodent astrocytes resulted in mutually synergistic maturation, and that cell type-specific expression data can be extracted using only sequencing read alignments without potentially disruptive cell sorting. We lastly developed and validated a computational tool to estimate the relative neuronal maturity of iPSC-derived neuronal cultures and human brain tissue, which were maturationally heterogeneous but contained subsets of cells most akin to adult human neurons."
