abstract = "The recount2 project re-processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on over 70,000 human RNA-seq samples spanning a variety of tissues, cell types and disease conditions. Researchers can easily access these data via the `recount` Bioconductor package, and can quickly import gene, exon, exon-exon junction, transcript and base-pair coverage data for uniformly processed data from the SRA, GTEx and TCGA projects in R for analysis. This talk will cover different use cases of the `recount` package, including downloading and normalizing data, processing and cleaning relevant phenotype data, performing differential expression (DE) analyses, and creating reports for exploring the results using other Bioconductor packages."
