# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "The recount2 project re-processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on over 70,000 human RNA-seq samples spanning a variety of tissues, cell types and disease conditions. Researchers can easily access these data via the `recount` Bioconductor package, and can quickly import gene, exon, exon-exon junction, transcript and base-pair coverage data for uniformly processed data from the SRA, GTEx and TCGA projects in R for analysis. This talk will cover different use cases of the `recount` package, including downloading and normalizing data, processing and cleaning relevant phenotype data, performing differential expression (DE) analyses, and creating reports for exploring the results using other Bioconductor packages."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's *Slides* feature and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
