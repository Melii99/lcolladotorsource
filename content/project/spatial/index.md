In 2020 we published the [first pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.969931v1) using the 10x Genomics Visium platform for spatial transcriptomics. For this project we created the [`spatialLIBD`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/spatialLIBD) Bioconductor package and started developing new analytical methods for this type of data.
