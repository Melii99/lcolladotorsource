In 2015 we re-processed all the human RNA-seq that was publicly available at the time in an effort to improve the usability of this complex type of data and to facilitate developing new bioinformatic and biostatistical methods. Via `recount2` we have democratized the access to this rich data and this project has lead to many different publications by the `recount2` team and other researchers.

More recently, we are working on a subset of brain samples from `recount2` for the `recount-brain` project lead by [Ashkaun Razmara](/authors/arazmara/).
