The Lieber Institute and pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca, Astellas, Eli Lilly and Company, Lundbeck, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Roche are participating in an early-stage research consortium BrainSEQ™, with the goal of expanding knowledge around the genetic contribution to brain disorders in the hope of identifying potential new treatment options.

* Utilizing LIBD’s unprecedented brain tissue repository to generate and analyze genomic data related to neuropsychiatric disorders.
* Making data freely available to scientists worldwide.

As part of the BrainSEQ Consortium, I have analyzed datasets from Phase I and II , either for the publications describing those phases or for re-analyses of the same data. We then adapted this code base for the BipSeq and MDDSeq projects, among other ones.
